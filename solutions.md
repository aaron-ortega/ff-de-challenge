## Coding Exercise Solutions

#### Quick Links
1. Data has been profiled and discussed in a jupyter [notebook](./src/profile_data.ipynb). 
Here's a [HTML](./notebooks) version which will render the maps; please open in your browser of choice.

2. An automated process can be found in [./src/main.py](./src/main.py).

3. All valid point and overlaps can be found in Mapbox. The polygon colors red and blue describe walking
distance one can travel after 5 and 10 min, respectively. Here is the [map](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/aortega04/ck908h7be005k1iny7a6ztux3/draft.html?fresh=true&title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiYW9ydGVnYTA0IiwiYSI6ImNrOHdlNW1heDBkaHczZm1jYmRmOWNobnUifQ.P1NVUDHPJ4DZb1g_XQRAzQ).

4. The number of overlaps per coordinates can be found in [./data/cleaned_data.json](./data/cleaned_data.json)
under the "overlap" key.
